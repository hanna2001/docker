Why docker:
    developement and product server will be different 
    dev-prod parity:
        - localhost:
            difficulties:
                - version differences
                - os differences
            advantages:
                - perfoemace
                - no layers
        - vm:
            dis:
                - performance
                - configurational drift : new upadtes
            advantage:
                - robust separation
                -

        - container
            runs from host but separately
            not all hardware gets simulated : perfmomace
            no configuration drift : containers not get updated, only images do
            can run anywhere
